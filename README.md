# Datsuzei Client
Datsuzei Client is a Minecraft utility mod aiming at improving the user experience by adding various tweaks such as additional hud, improved game performance, automating certain game mechanics, and so on and so forth.

I made this open source to overcome the fear of someone stealing a private client I'd been developing and decompiling it for the public, and of course to get help from the various people on github.
